   "description": "Welcome to my cocktail app! This is a website that I created to help you find and enjoy various cocktails. You can search cocktails by name and get information such as how to make them, what ingredients they have, and more. I created this website using Nuxt3, TypeScript, Cocktail API, and TailwindCSS. I also used some images from Unsplash for the landing page. This website is my first Nuxt3 project and I learned a lot from it. I learned about layout, components, pages directories, useFetch, and other features of Nuxt3. I loved how easy and fun it was to use Nuxt3 for this project. I hope you like my website and find it useful. Cheers!"
